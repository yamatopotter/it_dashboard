## 1.3 Process Introduction

Omada's Open API supports the REST API of most Controller services. This feature allows Omada users to write custom applications, embed APIs, or combine their own applications. The REST API supports HTTP GET and POST operations by providing specific URLs for each query. The output of these operations is returned in JSON format. To access the API securely, the Omada API framework supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization, which allows you to access resources authorized by users without obtaining user names and passwords, and supports the authorization code mode and client credentials mode.

The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.

The following is the authorization code mode process：

1、The user visits the client.

2、The client directs the user to the authentication server (Omada).

3、User logs in (/openapi/login), and authorize the third-party client.

4、The authentication server directs the user to the redirection URL specified by the client in advance, and attaches an authorization code (redirect URL + ?code={authorization code}, if the redirect URL is [https://redirect.com](https://redirect.com/), it is [https://redirect.com?code=authCode](https://redirect.com/?code=authCode)).

5、The client uses the authorization code to exchange the accessToken from the authentication server (Omada).

6、The authentication server (Omada) authenticates the client and issues an access token.

7、The client uses the access token to apply for resources from the resource server (Omada).

8、The resource server (Omada) confirms the access token and opens resources to the client.

9、The client can exchange an access token through refresh token, client ID, and client secret.

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).

The following is the client credentials mode process：

1、The user opens the client, and the client requires the user to authorize.

2、The user agrees to authorize the client.

3、The client uses the authorization obtained to apply for an access token from the authentication server (Omada).

4、The authentication server (Omada) authenticates the client and issues an access token.

5、The client uses the access token to apply for resources from the resource server (Omada).

6、The resource server (Omada) confirms the access token and open resources to the client.

7、The client can exchange an access token through refresh token, client ID, and client secret.

**Note**: Most interface has a concurrency limit. We recommend that you modify global configurations before other configurations of the site.

# 2 Access Process

## 2.1 Create Application

1、To access the Open API, first create an application at **Settings > Platform Integration** in the MSP or Global view. You can customize the content.：

- **Authorization code mode**: You can define the Application name and Redirect URL. When calling the interface in this mode, the authority is the same as that of the login user.
- **Client mode**: You can define the Application name and access permissions. When calling the interface in this mode, the rights are the same as the login Application.

2、After the creation is successful, each Application will have a corresponding client ID and client secret, which will be used for subsequent access to the Open API. You can view the details on the interface to know the Omada ID and the access address of the Open API.

## 2.2 Authorization Code Mode Access Process

### 2.2.1 Login Authentication & Obtain Authorization Code

#### 2.2.1.1 redirect URL not specified

When the redirect URL is not specified, the operation process is as follows.

First of all, you need to log in. When using the Open API function later, its authority is the same as that of the current login user. The login interface uses the **POST** method, the interface path is **/openapi/authorize/login.**

- In the **Query**, fill in the **client ID** (The field name is **client\_id**) and **msp id** or **customer id**(The field name is **omadac\_id**).
- In the **Body**, fill in the **user name**(The field name is **username**) and **password**(The field name is **password**).

After logging in successfully, it will return the **csrfToken**, **sessionId**.

**Note**: Please save the return parameters for later use.

An example of the curl command of the login interface is as follows:

**Request:**

```
curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/login?client_id=38f2d1b616434374b3f3215246f39940&omadac_id=beed48c7a2b0ea97c9698408843119f3" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"username":"admin","password":"tplink123"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
```

**Response:**

```
{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Log in successfully.","result":{"csrfToken":"51cb83c7d00a4e85b3dd2d6174a614d9","sessionId":"2fc0ca155ab94957a9a9e6a3b00662ea"}}
```

After logging in, you need to obtain the authorization code. The **obtaining the authorization** interface uses the **POST** method, the interface path is as follows: **/openapi/authorize/code**.

- In the **Query**, fill in the **client ID**(The field name is **client\_id**) and **response type**(The field name is **response\_type**), **msp id** or **customer id**(The field name is **omadac\_id**). The response\_type represents the reply type, and is filled with " **code**" by default in authorization code mode.
- In the **Headers**, fill in the **csrf token**(The field name is **Csrf-Token**) and **cookie**(The field name is **Cookie**) obtained in the login step. Note that the prefix **"TPOMADA\_SESSIONID="** is required when filling in the **cookie**.
After obtaining authorization code successfully, it will return the authorization code.

**Note**: The authorization code is only available for 2 minutes. If it expires, you need to obtain it again.

An example of the curl command of the **obtaining authorization code** interface is as follows:

**Request:**

```
curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/code?client_id=29f2fdbeb5a84d50b9b1cdd08cd1a3ff&omadac_id=de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1&response_type=code" -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'Csrf-Token:ae6b935c92cf4b1b9f3eb852e20ed2b8' -H 'Cookie:TPOMADA_SESSIONID=9cb86bf3a99e48a59e4f3bb464a3c443' -X POST -i -k --insecure
```

**Response:**

```
{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Authorize successfully.","result":"OC-9iyxaKVOVMBpYhQ4NryaYBjghj3dTY32"}
```

#### 2.2.1.2 redirect URL already specified

When the redirect URL is specified, the operation process is as follows.

Omada customized the login page for the third party. Note that client ID is required to carry. When logging in directly through the login page, the user will be redirected to the third-party service with the authorization code. For example, if the redirect URL is [http://test.com:8082/redirect/test](http://test.com:8082/redirect/test), Omada will send a redirect request [http://test.com:8082/redirect/test?code={authorization](http://test.com:8082/redirect/test?code=%7Bauthorization) code}, and the client can directly parse the authorization code for subsequent processing. If you don't know your login URL, go to **Settings > Platform Integration > Open API**, find your application and click the View button to check the **Oauth Login Page Address**.

- In the **Query**, fill in the **client ID**(The field name is **client\_id**)

**Note**: If you need to redirect the authorization code, please contact our technical support to add your domain name to the trusted list of the Omada system.

### 2.2.2 Obtain Access Token

After the authorization code is obtained, it will be used to obtain the access token. The **obtaining the access token** interface uses the **POST** method, the interface path is as follows: **/openapi/authorize/token**.

- In the **Query**, fill in the **grant type**(The field name is **grant\_type**). The grant type indicates the authentication method, and the authorization code needs to be filled in with " **authorization\_code**"
- In the **Body**, fill in the **client ID**(the field name is **client\_id**) and **client secret**(the field name is **client\_secret**).

After obtaining access token successfully, it will return the **access token**(The field name is **accessToken**), **token type**(The field name is **tokenType**), **expire time**(The field name is **expiresIn**, unit is second), **refresh token**(The field name is **refreshToken**).

An example of the curl command of the **obtaining access token** interface is as follows:

**Request:**

```
curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?grant_type=authorization_code&code=OC-y8fyWAyICCqCWw44Oi9GeSr7fQIKHg7g" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"client_id": "29f2fdbeb5a84d50b9b1cdd08cd1a3ff", "client_secret": "cf6b13af0dd045628c9f05f088eb5493"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
```

**Response:**

```
{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-bllLYOOYASck11SBSDmmHs85lCrkN6Gi","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7200,"refreshToken":"RT-HqvaDuSxEqayM75U2ukTRnBl6f6fiRAc"}}
```

### 2.2.3 Access API Interface

After obtaining access token, it will be used to access API interfaces.

- In the **Header**, fill in the access token. Note prefix of the access token in the Authorization header is **"AccessToken="** .

Other parameters can be filled in according to the description in the online document

An example of the curl command of the **get site list interface** is as follows:

**Request:**

```
curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/v1/de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1/sites?pageSize=1&page=1" -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'Authorization:AccessToken=AT-RCio7FS9p46wSD7dM8CwNQA7ylcrmAcV' -X GET -i -k --insecure
```

**Response:**

```
{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Success.","result":{"totalRows":1,"currentPage":1,"currentSize":1,"data":[{"siteId":"640effd1b3f2ae5b912275ec","name":"323233232","region":"China mainland","timeZone":"UTC","scenario":"Hotel","type":0}]}}
```

### 2.2.4 Refresh Access Token

Currently, the **access token** is valid for **2 hours**, and the **refresh token** is valid for **14 days**. If the access token expires, you can use the **refresh token** interface to obtain a new access token. The refresh access token interface uses the **POST** method, the interface path is as follows: **/openapi/authorize/token**. If the refresh token also expires, you will need to go through the previous authentication process again.

- In the **Query**, fill in the **grant type**(The field name is **grant\_type**), **refresh token**(The field name is **refresh\_token**). The grant type indicate the authentication method, and the refresh token needs to be filled in with " **refresh\_token**"
- In the **Body**, fill in the **client ID**(the field name is **client\_id**) and **client secret**(the field name is **client\_secret**).

An example of the curl command of the **refresh token** interface is as follows:
**Request:**

```
curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?client_id=185586e0df424f5ea938de13cba91e01&client_secret=767372a5258a4fc1a03c57f3d071fc35&refresh_token=RT-AhzwqCenDCZ84qpBHnZhYs3j2RGw9q8E&grant_type=refresh_token" -H 'content-type:application/json' -X POST -i -k --insecure
```

**Response:**

```
{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-w9veJNQlaK8dH08qEQZCTas6y70IRAii","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7001,"refreshToken":"RT-AhzwqCenDCZ84qpBHnZhYs3j2RGw9q8E"}}
```

## 2.3 Client Credentials Mode Access Process

### 2.3.1 Obtain Access Token

The client credentials mode can directly obtain the access token without the need to **obtain the authorization code**.

- In the **Query**, fill in the **grant type**(the field name is **grant\_type**). The grant type indicate the authentication method, and the client credentials code needs to be filled in with " **client\_credentials**"
- In the **Body**, fill in the **msp id** or **customer id**(The field name is **omadacId**), **client ID**(the field name is **client\_id**) and **client secret**(the field name is **client\_secret**).

An example of the curl command of the **obtaining access token** interface is as follows:
**Request:**

```
curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?grant_type=client_credentials" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"omadacId": "de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1", "client_id": "185586e0df424f5ea938de13cba91e01", "client_secret": "767372a5258a4fc1a03c57f3d071fc35"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
```

**Response:**

```
{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-bjaJkIMIiekZY6NBufoQO4hdmJTswlwU","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7200,"refreshToken":"RT-3ZjJgcORJSh76UCh7pj0rs5VRISIpagV"}}
```

**Note**: After obtaining the token, if you copy or import sites, or change application permission-related parameters (such as role/site/customer privilege) in the controller, the original token will become invalid and you need to authorize it again.

### 2.3.2 Access API Interface

This step is the same as the authorization code mode.

### 2.3.3 Refresh Access Token

This step is the same as the authorization code mode.

## 2.4 Batch Processing OpenAPIs

You can process up to 20 other OpenAPIs through the OpenAPI **Batch Processing OpenAPIs**, excluding MSP OpenAPIs. All processing should use the same omadacId.

In MSP mode, You can process up to 20 other OpenAPIs through the OpenAPI **Batch Processing MSP OpenAPIs**. For dealing with MSP OpenAPIs, the same mspId should be used. For dealing with other non MSP OpenAPIs, the corresponding customerId should be used.
